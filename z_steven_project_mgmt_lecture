His suggestion is Trello
  Icebox - Dreamlist...try to keep prioritized
  TODO - end of day
  Doing - active
  Done - on master github, on heroku

  Focus features thru user stories
    "As a student I should be able to add my repos and contribs so that it an be tracked..."
    "As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>"
    Stories are way to start a conversation

  Points
    an estimate about how hard you think a task will be
    points are usually wrong...but will even out
      use fib #s to show
      q, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
    try to keep tasks around 1,2,3
    Try to do as many points as you did yesterday
    prioritize, assign points

  In cards, use check lists
