- sessions (controller, views)
- registrations (controller, views)
- use devise for above instead? or with above? look into this
- basic new gathering form
- location, activity (scaffolds? models, controllers, etc.) belong to gatherings
- how do we represent times?
  - http://martinfowler.com/apsupp/recurring.pdf
  - ical gem? does that solve the problem?
  - schedule object? occurence?
  - ranges or a point in time and an optional estimated duration on gatherings object?
- seed data (fakr)
- basic user flow:
  1. login / account creation
  2. gathering index
  3. create new gathering
    a. add type column to interest?
    b. TODO: how do we store/represent invitations?
    c. for now, invitations will be automatically accepted
  4. show gathering: list of users, title


2/1 TODO
  - how do we implement comments?
    -chat room-esque?  comment on specific things?
    -explain your vote?

    - Activity feed?
      - read into how people have done this
  - Location
    - basic: no geocoder...text field
    - advanced: AJAX, suggest locations
  - Devise stuff
    - want to invite other users, this will help


  TO DO
  can't remove USERS


  // $("#moments-list").append("<%= j render partial: 'moment', locals: { moment: @moment, @gathering: @gathering } %>");
