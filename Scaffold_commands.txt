  - ical gem? does that solve the problem?
  - schedule object? occurence?
  - ranges or a point in time and an optional estimated duration on gatherings object?
- seed data (fakr)
- basic user flow:
  1. login / account creation
  2. gathering index
  3. create new gathering
    a. add type column to interest?
    b. TODO: how do we store/represent invitations?
    c. for now, invitations will be automatically accepted
  4. show gathering: list of users, title






Remove invited Users:
  - add 'remove' button to each user listed
  - button should post to gatherings controller (remove-users?)


Reorg to do:
  - move the invited users to the top
